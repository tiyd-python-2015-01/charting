# Chart data

## Description

Chart data about coin flips.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* Basic statistics
* The use of different plot types

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use matplotlib
* Use IPython Notebook
* Use the statistics module

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called charting containing at least:
  * an IPython notebook
  * a `requirements.txt` file

### Requirements  

* Passing unit tests
* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors

## Normal Mode

All of the following should be done in an IPython Notebook.

Create a function to flip a coin. It is up to you to determine what this
returns to signify heads or tails. Then create a function to run a simulation
of flipping a coin _n_ number of times, default 100000, recording how many heads
and tails it has at different intervals. The intervals are exponential, so
record at 2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, and so on until you reach _n_. Record the
final number as well.

Then make a line plot of the difference between heads and tails at each
recorded point, and another with the ratio of heads to tails at each recorded
point.

Create these plots again, but as scatter plots with a logarithmic scale for the
x-axis.

Write notes about what you observe. Feel free to add more plots to help you.

Now we will look at the mean and standard deviation of these trials of flipping
coins. Flip coins as before, but run 20 trials of 100000 each.

Use a scatter plot to plot the mean heads/tails ratio at each recorded point,
and another scatter plot to plot the standard deviation of the heads/tails
ratio at each recorded point. You will want to use a logarithmic scale for the
x-axis in both. You may want to do the same for the y-axis with the standard
deviation.

Write notes about what you observe. Feel free to add more plots to help you.

Lastly, run 100,000 trials of 100 coin flips each. Plot a histogram of the
ratio of heads to total flips for each trial. Run 100,000 trials of 1,000 coin
flips each and plot that histogram as well. Lastly, plot a box plot of your
results from the 100 coin flip trials and your results from the 1,000 coin flip
trials.

What do you observe? Write up your notes.

If possible, add the mean and standard deviation as text to each histogram.
